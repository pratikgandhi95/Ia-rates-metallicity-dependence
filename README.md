# Metallicity-dependent Ia rates

This project explores metallicity-dependent modifications to Type Ia supernova rates, motivated by results from observational surveys of supernovae (ASAS-SN, Brown et al., 2019; DES, Wiseman et al., 2021) and from observations indicating that the close-binary fraction of solar-type stars in the Milky Way increases with decreasing metallicity (Moe, Kratter, and Badenes 2019). It also explores the impact of metallicity-dependent Ia rates on various aspects of formation and enrichment in galaxies using the FIRE-2 cosmological, baryonic, zoom-in simulations.

This repository contains Python scripts and data tables used to create all the figures in the associated paper (Gandhi, P. J., et al., 2022).
